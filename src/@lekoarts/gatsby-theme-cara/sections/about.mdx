## About me


#### <em>"If you work, things will work."</em>.

Hi,

I'm Bao Nguyen, a software engineer graduated from HCMC University of Techonology, Vietnam in 2020.<br/>
Maybe I'm not the best programmer yet, but I am a very quick learner.
With my passion for programming and my interpersonal skills, one day, I will become the best full-stack web developer you can ever find.
